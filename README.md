<!-- DISCRIPTION -->
### Description 
The purpose of our project is to study pressure and CO2 changes in the Ohaaki Geothermal Reservoir. We have developed a model of the concentration of CO2 and changes in the reservoirâ€™s concentration of CO2 using past data of the injections and production.

The pressure in the reservoir is also modelled and analysed in order to understand the effects of CO2 on the pressure and seepage of the reservoir. We have used this to look at the effects of expanding CO2 injection and to therefore make a recommendation for future CO2 injection so that they are safe and sustainable. 

<!-- INSTALLATION -->
### Installation
1. Get permission to access project
2. Clone the repo in command prompt to create local repository
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your_username_/263-Group-12.git

<!-- USAGE -->
### Usage
This project can be used to predict how different rates of CO2 injection will effect the geothermal field. The rates of future injection can be changed to predict the prospective effects and ensure that concentration does not exceed corrosive values of CO2.

This project requires data about the past injection and production rates of CO2 at the geothermal field, as well as concentration of CO2 and pressure data. These are under the folder data_sources. The more data used, the more accurate the model, so more can be added if required.
