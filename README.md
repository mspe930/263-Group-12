# Resource Consent Project: CO2 injection at Ohaaki Geothermal Field
## ENGGEN263 Group 12

### Description 
Models the concentration of CO2 and changes in the reservoir’s concentration of CO2 using past data of CEL’s injections and extractions thus far. To do so, the pressure in the reservoir is also modelled and analysed. 

This allows the user to understand the effects of CO2 on the pressure and seepage of the reservoir. The values of injection can be changed to predict the effects into the future and ensure that concentration does not exceed corrosive values of CO2.

This will require outside data about the past injection and production rates of CO2 at the geothermal field, as well as concentration and pressure data. These are under the folder data_sources. The more data used, the more accurate the model, so more can be added if required.
