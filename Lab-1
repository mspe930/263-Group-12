Why? 

Decide whether to quadruple CO2 injection rates, or remain the same at the Contact Energy Ohaaki Geothermal field. 
This is achieved through modelling of the pressure and CO2 changes in the reservoir.
Stakeholders: Contact Energy Ltd., Ngati Tahu, Waikato Regional Council
CEL want to expand the cogeneration of the reservoir. 
WRC want to ensure the underground storage of the CO2 is secure to avoid CO2 seeps into the waterways.
Ngati Tahu want to retain the current groundwater quality.
WRC and Ngati Tahu are both adhering to government freshwater standards. 

Option 1 is remaining at current cogeneration rates.
Option 2 would be granting consent to quadruple the injection rates.
Option 3 would be to increase injection rate, to a level lower than quadrupling.
