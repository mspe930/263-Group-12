Why? 

Decide whether to quadruple CO2 injection rates, or remain the same at the Contact Energy Ohaaki Geothermal field. 
This is achieved through modelling of the pressure and CO2 changes in the reservoir.
Stakeholders: Contact Energy Ltd., Ngati Tahu, Waikato Regional Council
CEL want to expand the cogeneration of the reservoir. 
WRC want to ensure the underground storage of the CO2 is secure to avoid CO2 seeps into the waterways.
Ngati Tahu want to retain the current groundwater quality.
WRC and Ngati Tahu are both adhering to government freshwater standards. 

Option 1 is remaining at current cogeneration rates.
Option 2 would be granting consent to quadruple the injection rates.
Option 3 would be to increase injection rate, to a level lower than quadrupling. 

How?

Modelling the CO2 concentration changes in the rock, pressure changes and net mass changes.
Using a computer model to take the input data subject to physical laws and predict the result of quadrupling the CO2 injection rate. 
We would build the model on a training set of data from the early period of the reservoir and calibrate using more recent data to ensure accuracy in future predictions. 

Given?

We have been given CO2 injection rates, extraction/production rates, pressure in the rock, CO2 concentration by wt% in the reservoir. 
These data sets cover from the establishment of the reservoir in the 1980s to 2018.

We would need to look up the government standards of freshwater. 
Pre-exploitation value
Boundary constants for the reaction rates and other equations, e.g. porosity, reaction rates

Assume?

Assumes the reservoir and field operate under normal physics principles.
